# Video-Summarization

## Overview
This project implements a bidirectional LSTM model for video summarization, inspired by the paper "Video Summarisation using LSTM". The model is trained on the SumMe and TVSum datasets.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code.
- `data/`: Datasets.
- `models/`: Trained models.
- `outputs/`: Generated video summaries.
- `logs/`: Logs for training and evaluation.

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
The model achieved F-scores of 34.6 on SumMe and 51.2 on TVSum datasets.
